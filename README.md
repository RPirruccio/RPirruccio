### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! I'm a software developer with a focus on building practical solutions to real-world problems. With experience in debugging and problem-solving, I have developed the skills necessary to tackle complex challenges.

My experience includes working with Python to solve semiconductor manufacturing supply chain problems, as well as building web applications using JavaScript. My passion for creating efficient and effective software systems drives me to continuously learn and improve my skills.

### A little about me..

As a dual Italian-American citizen, I am fluent in both Italian and English. Growing up in Houston, Texas for most of my life, I received my high school education there before graduating from the University of Texas at Tyler with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently residing in Austin, Texas, I am passionate about fitness, breakfast tacos, and live music, and I enjoy unwinding by exploring the beautiful state parks of central Texas through camping and hiking.
