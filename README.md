### A little about me..

As a dual Italian-American citizen, I am fluent in both Italian and English. Growing up in Houston, Texas for most of my life, I received my high school education there before graduating from the University of Texas at Tyler with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently residing in Austin, Texas, I am passionate about fitness, breakfast tacos, and live music, and I enjoy unwinding by exploring the beautiful state parks of central Texas through camping and hiking.
